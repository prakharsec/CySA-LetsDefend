# 🛡️ CompTIA CySA+ Preparation Journey via LetsDefend

Welcome to my cybersecurity learning portfolio! This repository documents my preparation for the **CompTIA CySA+ (Cybersecurity Analyst)** certification using the **LetsDefend Blue Team platform**. Over the course of this training, I gained hands-on experience with SIEM alert triage, malware analysis, phishing investigation, incident response, threat intelligence, and many core defensive concepts used in real-world SOC environments.
